# Speed Typing Test with Curses

This is a simple Python program using the curses library to create a speed typing test game. Players are presented with a random text from a file and are required to type it as quickly and accurately as possible.

## Features

- Randomly selects a text from a provided file for each round.
- Calculates and displays the typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
- Supports backspace for correcting mistakes while typing.
- Provides a user-friendly interface using curses for terminal-based interaction.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and the curses library installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the program using the command `python speed_typing_test.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to start and complete the typing test.

## File Structure

- `speed_typing_test.py`: Contains the main Python code for the typing test game.
- `text.txt`: Contains the sample texts used for the typing test. You can modify or add more texts to this file as needed.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- curses library (standard library in Python)

## Acknowledgments

This program is inspired by various speed typing tests available online and is created for educational and recreational purposes.
